innovid reporting?

issue with AZ?
   - what is a dashboard?

talk to spencer about
    - cc'ing krystal on emails
    - not asking for disjointed data

"don't say your bored"


spencer's dream report:
  - more graphs and charts
  - dcm vs dsp discrepancies (between/below 10%)
  - monday to sunday can be taken out
  - day over day, week over week
  - 
  - completion rate vs click-through-rate
  - mobile vs display vs video
  - viewability vs platform (moat vs dsp)
  - measureable impressions
  - above-the-fold impressions (dv/integral/moat(dsp))

note 'deal id' is a way to reserve a spot in 'private market place' auctions
